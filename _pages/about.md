This is the the professional website for Theodore Landsman, Senior Political Analyst at YouGov Blue and Phd Candidate in Government at Georgetown University (not to be confused with my grandfather, Theodore Landsman, who was a Humanistic Psychologist at the University of Florida). Browse this website to find info on my work and forthcoming projects. 
I have collaborated with Professors Hans Noel (Georgetown), Michael Bailey (Georgetown), Paul Gronke (Reed College), Darius Rejali (Reed College), and Dartmouth postdoctoral fellow Yuki Atsusaka on projects that have received funding from the Democracy Fund, the New America Foundation, the Arnold Foundation, and other sources. Prior to beginning my PhD studies, I was the Research Manager at FairVote, where I collaborated with the Ranked Choice Voting Resource Center, Sightline, and the MGGG Redistricting Lab on a wide variety of projects related to Ranked Choice Voting. My current research agenda focuses on clustering and ideal point estimation, voter ideology, and political reform.
